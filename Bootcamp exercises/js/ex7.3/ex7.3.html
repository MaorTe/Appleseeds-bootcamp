		<!-- 1. create 2 book objects with properties: name, author, year.
2. create an empty object bookUtils (utils = short for utilities).
3. add to to the bookUtils object a function getFirstPublished, that recieves 2
books and returns the book with the smaller year.
4. add to to the bookUtils object a function setNewEdition, that recieves a
book and an edition year and sets a new property latestEdition with the
edition year, or updates an existing one.

5. add to to the bookUtils object a setLanguage function, that recieves a book
and a language and sets a new property language with the languahe, or
updates an existing one.

6. add to to the bookUtils object a setTranslation function, that recieves a
book a language and a translator, and sets a new property of translation,
which is an object that contains the translator and the language.

7. add to to the bookUtils object a setPublisher function, that recieves a book
a name and a location, and sets a new property named publisher, which is an
object that contains the name and location.

8. add to to the bookUtils object a function isSamePublisher, that recieves 2
books and checks if the publisher name and location are identical in the 2
books. -->
